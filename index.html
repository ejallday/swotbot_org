        <h2>Our Goal</h2>
        <img src="images/students.png" alt="">
        <p>Our goal is to change the face of education in the United States and create  
          an environment where students, regardless of background have the same 
          opportunities to go to college. We believe that SWOT Bot combined with 
          programming courses can give students in underfunded, underprivileged 
          communities the help they need to attend college.
        </p>

        <h4>$35,000 – Computer lab</h4>

        <p>On August 26, 2013, just three days after graduating from Dev Bootcamp, Rachel  
          was back in the classroom. Aside from her regular duties of teaching 
          subjects like History and English, Rachel decided to share her love and 
          knowledge of programming with her students… Without computers!
        </p>

        <p>Computers are cheap. There is absolutely no reason that in one of the wealthiest  
          countries in the world, our schools do not have adequate supplies to teach our 
          children. We aim to solve this, one school at a time.
        </p>

        <p>The first $35,000 raised will supply enough workstations for 30 students.  
          All additional money raised will go directly to supporting the SWOT Bot 
          (the student behavior tracking system we created while attending <a href="http://devbootcamp.com">Dev Bootcamp</a>), 
          its expansion and our goal of sharing this tool with teachers across the United States. 
        </p>

        <p>Thank you for your support.</p>

        <h2>About SWOT</h2>
        <img src="images/live-view.png" alt="">


        <p>Founded by Rachel Warbelow and Ben Salkowe, SWOT is the first high-achieving, 
          college-prep pathway for middle school students in East Las Vegas. Driven by high 
          expectations, rigorous assessments, expanded instruction, and one-of-a-kind field 
          lessons, our 120 students are redefining the possibilities for public education in 
          Nevada.
        </p>

        <p>After 4 frustrating years of tracking of student behavior, grades, and attendance on 
          paper and inserting it into spreadsheets, Rachel took matters into her own hands 
          and decided to attend Dev Bootcamp during her summer break in 2013.
        </p>

        <p>At Dev Bootcamp, Rachel learned how build full-stack web applications using Ruby, 
          Rails, Javascript, jQuery, and many other frameworks/languages. After seven and a 
          half intense weeks of training, Rachel teamed up with fellow students Allen Dayag, Jake Myers and 
          Eric Allen to create the SWOT Bot.
        </p>

        <p>In eight days, the SWOT Bot team created a fully functional student management system 
          that replaces the 20-hour process of tabulating student data with a sleek iPad 
          interface that allows teachers to track student progress in real-time. 
          SWOT Bot also enables students and their guardians to track their performance via 
          the web, email or SMS text.
        </p>
        
        <p>Additional features include:  
          <ul>
            <li>Internal messaging system for parents, teachers and students to communicate with one another</li>
            <li>Weighted gradebook</li>
            <li>Attendace</li>
            <li>Detention</li>
            <li>Student goals</li>
            <li>Daily quotes and inspirations to help students stay focused on attending college</li>
            <li>Email distribution of weekly SWOT reports</li>
            <li>SMS text broadcasting for teachers to notify groups of parents</li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <p>Our goal is to change the face of education in the United States and create an environment where students, 
          regardless of background have the same opportunities to go to college.

        <h2>Who We Are</h2>

        <p>The SWOT Bot team is made up of individuals but collectively, we believe  
          that every child in the United States should have access to a computer and the 
          opportunity to learn how to program.

          <h2>FAQ</h2>

          <h4 class="question">Is there a minimum amount I can donate?</h4>
          <div class="answer">
            <p>No. All donations make a difference. "A waterfall starts with a single drop of water." 
            </p>
          </div>

          <h4 class="question">If I donate, what will my money go towards?</h4>
          <div class="answer">
            <p>The first $35,000 will go to funding a computer lab for the students of the SWOT Program. We believe every student, regardless of 
              background and socioeconomic status can learn to code. As Steve Jobs said, "I think everybody in this country should learn how to program a computer, should learn a computer language, because it teaches you how to think.”  
            </p>

            <p>Any additional funding will go directly towards scaling the SWOT Bot and paying for the daily cost of running it. Text messages, 
              email and servers cost money. Currently, the SWOT Team has been paying for all these services out of pocket. 
            </p>

            <p>100% of all donations will go directly to funding the computer lab and to support the application and its development. 
              SWOTBot.org does not employ anyone and all developers volunteer their time.
            </p>
          </div>

          <h4 class="question">What is the SWOT Team?</h4>
          <div class="answer">
            <p>The SWOT Team, or Scholars Working OverTime, is the first college-prep, extended-day program for middle school students in East Las Vegas.
            Driven by high expectations, rigorous assessments, expanded instruction, and one-of-a-kind field lessons, our 120 students are redefining the possibilities for public education in Nevada.  We will get every student on our team to and through the college of their dreams. For more info visit theswotteam.org
            </p>
          </div>

          <h4 class="question">What is the SWOT Bot?</h4>
          <div class="answer">
            <p>The SWOT Bot is a web-based application that allows teachers to track student attendance, behavior (both positive and negative),
            assignments and grades in real time via an iPad. The SWOT Bot provides feedback to teachers, students and parents in real time over the web, email and SMS text messaging.
            </p>
          </div>

          <h4 class="question">Can I use the SWOT Bot for my classroom?</h4>
          <div class="answer">
            <p>Currently, we are still testing the SWOT Bot and adding functionality. Though our system is live and being used, we currently do not have the funding to scale the application and offer it to other schools. If you are interested in donating to help open source the SWOT Bot so that we can provide it free of charge to teachers everywhere, please contact us at info@swotbot.org.
